# Clothing-Item-Generator-ACGAN

This project is a clothing item image generator that utilizes an Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Network (ACGAN) architecture. The generator takes advantage of the Fashion MNIST dataset to produce realistic images of various clothing classes. ACGANs are a variant of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) that incorporate auxiliary classification information to generate images with specific attributes.
